# Specification-plots-using-Speccurve
Extensive robustness checks have become a requirement for empirical research. This often leads to Online Appendices with hundreds of result tables that are very hard to digest for readers and referees. Stata16â€™s speccurve command written by [Martin Eckhoff Andresen](https://sites.google.com/site/martineckhoffandresen/home) is an easy to use command that facilitates the generation of specification curves. The command can be download from here. Unfortunately, the command does not currently work with older versions of Stata. A specification curve plots a large number of regression coefficients and confidence intervals sorted by estimated impact from different specifications that allow the assessment of robustness in a single figure like the one included below.
